    "In this seminar we implement an example of the agent-environment interface used in reinforcement learning, called \"gridworld\".\n",

    "The world consists of an $n \\times m$ grid of squares, indexed by $(i,j)$ with $i = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$ and $j = 0, 1, \\dots, m-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state of the environment consists of the player being in one of the squares.\n",

    "- Some squares can give positive/negative rewards\n",
    "- Squares might be \"blocked\" and not possible to step on\n",
    "- Stepping off the board is impossible\n",
    "- Invalid moves might give a negative reward as \"punishment\"\n",
    "- There might be \"portals\" that take the player to a distant square, regardless of their action\n",
    "- There might be deterministic or random effects that change the outcome of actions, e.g. \"wind\" or \"ice\"."
